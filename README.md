# json2html (Works! But is not finished)

Converts JSON data to an HTML table. This table can be copied and pasted into confluence docs or any other location.

Unlike an online json2html converter, you have assurance that all operations take place locally and no requests are made.

This is a draft. Much of the script file can be credited to this article by geeksforgeeks
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-json-data-to-a-html-table-using-javascript-jquery/

Use

-   Open the app in vs code or in finder
-   Drag json2html.html into your browser
-   Add your data as the value of data in script.js
-   click the button to produce an html table with your data
-   Copy and paste your new data table

Future Changes

-   Add text input for json data. This way, a user does not have to toucht the code
-   Add a run script
-   Convert to react and typescript
-   Add option to add the table to clipboard automatically. Some tables will surely be longer that the screen height. This will make it easier and faster to transfer the table to confluence.
